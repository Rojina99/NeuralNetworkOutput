Here the main class to be run is ReadInput.java that is under the package readcsv.

We can input the values of parameters as per pimaindianwhole.csv.

Otherwise user donot have diabetes.

Here notice that the parameter diabetes pedigree has no actual relevance.
We need a whole different set of algorithm to take input of diabetes pedigree from actual users.
